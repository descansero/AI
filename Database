#The database should be an specific 
array whichs must have 0's and 1's like the one that is in the code above.An example of this would be something like this:

arr=arr[0,0,1,1,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0]]

#However if you want to use more numbers or data it is essential that you change 

np.random.random((6, 3)) - 1

#Instead of the six put the quantity of separte numbers for example:

np.random.random((7, 3)) - 1

#Then the array should be

arr=arr[0,0,1,1,0,0,0]
